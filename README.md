Spritestacker is tool to make drawing sprite stack easier. It features a Layer system for the Z axis and a live preview of the final render.

## Getting Started

To install SpriteStacker go over the release tab and download the lasted version. Simply launch the SpriteStacker.exe in a folder and All of your exports will be next to this executable in a folder named after your exported sprites.

## Installing palettes

Even though SpriteStacker comes with a bunch from Lospec.com, you might want to import your own. SpriteStacker only supports .hex files, but it is very easy to convert any palette to this format. Hex files are simply all of the hex values one after the other in a text file. Palettes are located at : `%appdata%/Godot/app_userdata/StackedSprites/Palettes/`

## How to use

SpriteStacker is pretty simple to use, you have your drawing board on the left along with the palette inspector( You can load them with the button just above), you also have the layer view on the right just above the Previewer. You can add layers with the Plus button.

To move the previewer you have small arrows on the bottom left corner of the Preview window. There is also a + and - buttons to increase the resolution of the renderer. You will need to adjust the zoom after adjusting the resolution.

If you don't know how to use those assets in your game, I suggest that you read this article that explains the process of achieving the effect. NOTE: this software is only useful in the making of those sprites. not to make it easier to use in your game as this step is fairly easy to solve.
